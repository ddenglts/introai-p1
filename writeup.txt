1. Explain the design and algorithm for your Bot 4, being as specific as possible as to what your bot is actually
doing. How does your bot factor in the available information to make more informed decisions about what to
do next?

2, For each bot, repeatedly generate test environments and evaluate the performance of the bot, for many values
of q between 0 and 1. Graph the probability (or average frequency, rather) of the bot successfully putting out
the fire. Be sure to repeat the experiment enough times to get accurate results for each bot, and each tested
value of q.

3, When bots fail or get trapped by the fire, why do they fail? Was there a better decision they could have made
that would have saved them? Why or why not? Support your conclusions.
Bot1: 
Bot 1 fails or gets trapped by fire because it does not consider the spread of the fire. Bot 1 is only aware of the initial fire cell
and does not where the fire is spreading. Therefore, although bot1 will choose the quickest path, it will not choose the safest path
and does not have the ability to adjust its path. It can make a better decision by continuosly tracking the spread of the fire.
This will allow Bot 1 it consider a new approach and path after the each timestep.

Bot 2: Bot 2 fails or gets trapped by fire because it doesn't look into the future and consider how the fire may spread. Although Bot 2
keeps track of the spread of the fire, it does not consider that traveling on cells that are adjacent to the fire can mean that it can bbe 
burned in the next timestep. It can make a better decision by looking into the future and not only track the spread of the fire, but its
ability to spread to adjacent cells during the next timestep. This can help prevent the Bot from being burned as often and improve its
success rate.

Bot 3: Bot 3 fails or gets trapped by the fire because it only looks 1 timestep into the future and does not consider how the fire may 
spread after that. Although Bot 3 will attempt to avoid cells adjacent to the fire, assuming that a path exists, it can still be easily
trapped as it does not look past one timestep in the future. As a result, Bot 3 is more likely to struggle in bigger ship sizes, as it
will still only look one timestep into the future and can easily be trapped by the fire especially when flammibility is high. It can 
make a better decision by considering more than 1 timestep in the future. As a result, Bot 3 is more likely to escape the fire, and less
likely to get trapped. In the interest computational power, we will scale how far Bot 3 looks into the future based on the size of the
ship. For example, if the size of the ship is 10 x 10, it will not look as far into the future compared to a ship that has a size 100 x 100.

4. Speculate on how you might construct the ideal bot. What information would it use, what information would
it compute, and how?

EVERY timestep, our ideal bot would first get the position of the button, fires, itself, and the layout of the ship. It would also
ideally get the flammibility of the ship. Using this information, the bot will construct a simulation of the ship, fires, button, etc.
It would then simulate its model (taking q into account) for ideally n -> infinity times, or a very big number. 
The simulation would be similar to the code used to actually update ship stuff according to timestep.
It would then look at the outcomes of the simulations. It would then look at what step (1 step) the bots that reached the button took. 
It would then take the most common step out of those bots and execute it.
